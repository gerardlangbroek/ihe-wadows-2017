# ihe-wadows-2017
Resources for the migration of [DICOM WADO-WS](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2017b/output/html/part18.html#sect_6.3) to IHE. 

## approach

The supportive resources (schemas and WSDL) have been copied from the last version of the DICOM standard that contained them (2017b) and edited to match the normative text as much as possible. Conflicts have been resolved, and a number of fixes have been made through PRs.

## Collaborating vendors
The initiative is started by these Dutch vendors to improve interoperability of image sharing in (Dutch) HIEs.
